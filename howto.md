## Use markdown for presentations

Built using [remark](https://remarkjs.com) & some java script tricks :  A simple, in-browser, markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS.

Style your code blocks with some remark-extension : 
Ex : 


```
private String a;
def myFunc():Unit={
  print("do something")
}
```
